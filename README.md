### Hey there!

I am Misir, writing code for more than 6 years now. I enjoy creating and playing around with different kinds of stuff with code. I've done working with clients as a freelance developer back when I was in school, then I came across with a few awesome guys and with the help and motivation from them I decided to work on something for longer term and we've founded [Fonibo](https://fonibo.com/en).

It's been about 3 years till I've written my first line of code for it. Rather than that I also enjoy working on Open Source projects because it did let me learn a lot of stuff over years. In general I enjoy software architecting, engineering (sometimes over-engineering), working on mind dangling problems. My favourite language is - none. I don't like them all because I don't have to. I just use whatever could solve a problem I'm having. In general I usually code with: C#, Dart, Golang, TypeScript. 

##### Experiments:

I am considering creating a programming language - maybe just for fun, learning or maybe solving a real problems I'm having. I just haven't yet considered what it should going to be. It might end up in abondomed projects list. Maybe not - still considering. It's probably going to be a scripting / tooling kind of language for creating small scripts like code generator or shell scripts or maybe not, I'm still considering...

Btw check out an [crafting interpereters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) if you want to learn how does programming programming language happens.

##### Maintaining:

- [hive](https://github.com/hivedb/hive) - Lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart.
- [phonenumbers](https://github.com/fonibo/phonenumbers) - Phonelibrary validation & UI widget written in pure Dart (without any native bindings like libphonenumbers).
- [meilisearch-dart](https://github.com/TheMisir/meilisearch-dart) - MeiliSearch API in dart programming language.

*The projects above are ones I usually spend more time maintaining than others.*

##### My blog:

You can read my personal blog articles here at [themisir.com](https://themisir.com). I'm usually posting about software engineering, my life and startups - not specific on one topic.
