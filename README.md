#### Hi,

I am Misir, doing software engineering for about 7 years or so. I like what I do, and when I don't I can find excuses to procrastinate until the last day of the deadline. I like learning about how stuff works under the hood, and that's how I eventually got to this point.

I write on [my blog](https://themisir.com) semi-regularly about software engineering, startups, business and some personal essays.
