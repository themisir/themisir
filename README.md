### Hey there!

I am Misir, writing code for more than 5 to 7 years (I don't remember exactly when I started). I spend most of my time thinking things I can code right now. Then I spend the rest to find a good playlist to listen while actually writing the code. I started my SWE career as a freelance developer, finished projects using various tech stacks from Windows application to messy web sites I built using framework of myself which I'm definitely not proud of ([I really did!](https://github.com/whilend/Superfast)). But it's life, we don't always make good decisions but we have to move on.

<summary><b>Professional career</b></summary>

The main jumpstart of my "professional" career started with me and a few other guys and gals together deciding to founding a startup. I spend most of my days and nights working on it, I left university to have more free time to laugh at memes and spend the rest to work on the project. I am not gonna lie, founding a company and running it was a hell a lot of stressful thing to deal with. Sometimes I wished I didn't commited at all into it. But after all I don't regret it, or any other decisions it might have lead to. It gave me lots of opportunities, I met lots of great people, had chance to say "hello" and sit on mute for hours on meetings with some popular VC firms and enterprises. I made up lots of friendships at that company. There was some moments with slight drama but that's also needed to add some spiciness to the life. It gave me chance to start my career from the top of the career ladder and see how things are going up there (stressful af). (todo: write a blog post to expand this story).

<summary><b>Open source</b></summary>

Aside from commercial involvement somehow I also got into working on various Open Source projects on various scales and had chance to met or interact with some awesome people from the community! If you ask me "how to start contributing to open source", I would say don't do it just for the sake of doing it. You won't enjoy the process. I started my open source involvement to speed up my own development process by fixing some issues on open source libraries I use. So instead of waiting days or months to get a fix I just worked on fixing it myself and proposed the changes.

Here's some of the remarkable contributions I'm proud to share: [dart-lang/pub#3007](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/pull/3007), [hivedb/hive](https://github.com/hivedb/hive), aand that's it, It aint much but it's honest work. Aside from all of that I am currently working on various stuff which I can't talk about because of NDAs and the rest is just junk weekend projects. My current favourite programming language is - none. I don't like any of them, all of them have something that feels not complete or not usable for certain use cases. I just use whatever I want when I need one. But lately I usually pick one of those: C#, TypeScript, Dart, Golang, SQL, and belowed HTML.
