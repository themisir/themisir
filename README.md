#### Hello there,

General Kenobi. I write software. I like Rustlang and Golang, but have to write C# instead. I like writing systems software, low level stuff, playing with bits and bytes, sometimes exploring deep into CPU level and when bored I may prefer to write some HTML+CSS as well.

- I write blogs and essays, or sometimes post some photos on [https://themisir.com](https://themisir.com)
- I maintain my own little infrastructure for running self-hosted and some self-made tools
- I work at bp, mostly doing system level software engineering
- I hate Microsoft due to their non consumer friendly behavior (though I may eventually work there)
- I will write my own game engine and A Game! from scratch

That's a darn long list to describe me, it's not an authentic one because it's a public one, but I tried to be as realistic as possible while being employer friendly (except MSFT).

Email me if you wanna talk (:
